                      <h2> About Me </h2>
                      <p>
                        Prior to moving to Seattle in January 2018 I worked the previous 6 years as a Police officer in Western Australia. I found I enjoyed the work but after 6 years of working night shifts and missing out on holidays and special occasions I realized that I never really had a passion for the job and was only continuing to do it because I was unsure what I really wanted to do. This all changed when I moved to Seattle.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For the first time in many years, I found myself with a large amount of free time to explore new hobbies and interests. I decided that I wanted to learn something new, possibly a different language. That's when my wife suggested that I might be interested in learning to code. What initially started off as a couple of hours here and there completing online courses very soon turned into a full-time hobby. It wasn't long after that I realized that I didn't want it to be just another hobby and that I wanted to pursue it as a career.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Over the next few months I spent as much time as I could teaching myself the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby), before enrolling in Flatiron School's Software Engineering course. The program helped me greatly improve my skills with extensive course-work primarily focused on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        My past studies include a Bachelors Degree with a double major in Economics and Finance from Curtin University of Technology. I also have a number of  qualifications from my time as a Police Officer, including a Diploma in Public Safety.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I am currently looking for a Software Engineering role that will both challenge me and enable me to continue to learn and improve on my growing skillset as a full stack developer. Although my current personal projects are focused on using Rails and React, I am willing and excited to learn any technologies required.
                      </p>
